                <p>Web development is an exciting field with endless possibilities. Whether you're just starting your journey or looking to expand your skills, this guide will help you understand the fundamentals and set you on the path to success.</p>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>The web development landscape has evolved dramatically over the past decade. Today, building a website requires not just HTML and CSS, but also JavaScript, frameworks, databases, and understanding of user experience design.</p>
                <h4>The Three Pillars of Web Development</h4>
                <p>HTML forms the structure of your web pages. It's the foundation upon which everything else is built. CSS brings style and layout to your pages, making them visually appealing. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior, making your websites come alive.</p>
                <h4>Getting Your Tools Ready</h4>
                <p>Start with a good code editor like VS Code or Sublime Text. Install Node.js for JavaScript development. Learn Git for version control. These tools will become your daily companions in web development.</p>
               
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>Web development is a journey, not a destination. Keep learning, build projects, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Every expert was once a beginner.</p>

                    <h3>ARTICLE 2: 10 Best Practices for Clean Code</h3>
                      <p><b>Published:</b>  <time datetime="2024-01-05">January 5, 2024</time> | <b>Author:</b> Sarah Developer | <b>Reading Time: </b> <time datetime="">8 min</time>  </p>
                </header>
                <p>Writing clean code is not just about making your code work—it's about making it understandable, maintainable, and efficient. Here are ten essential practices every developer should follow.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><h4> Use Meaningful Variable Names</h4>
                    <p>Don't use single letters or abbreviations that only you understand. Names like <b>userData</b> and <b>calculateTotal </b> are far better than <b>d</b> or <b>ct</b>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Keep Functions Small and Focused</h4><p>Each function should do one thing and do it well. If your function is more than 20 lines, it's probably trying to do too much.</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Comment Your Why, Not Your What</h4>
                    <p>Code shows what it does. Comments should explain why you did it that way. Bad: <b>// increment i</b>. Good: <b>// skip deleted records</b>.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>DRY Principle - Don't Repeat Yourself</h4>
                        <p>If you find yourself writing the same code twice, it's time to refactor. Extract it into a function or component.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4> Use Consistent Formatting</h4>
                        <p>Follow a consistent style guide. Better yet, use tools like Prettier and ESLint to enforce consistency automatically.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Handle Errors Gracefully</h4>
                        <p>
                            Don't ignore errors. Catch them, log them, and provide meaningful messages to users.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Write Tests</h4>
                        <p>Tests give you confidence to refactor and deploy. Aim for at least 80% code coverage.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Avoid Magic Numbers</h4>
                        <p>Use named constants instead of hardcoded numbers scattered throughout your code.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Keep It Simple</h4>
                        <p>Avoid over-engineering. Simpler solutions are often better and easier to maintain.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Refactor Regularly</h4>
                        <p>Set aside time to improve existing code. Technical debt grows if ignored.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                 <h3>ARTICLE 3: React Hooks Explained for Beginners</h3>
                  <p><b>Published:</b>  <time datetime="2024-01-22">January 22, 2024</time> | <b>Author:</b> Mike Developer | <b>Reading Time: </b> <time datetime="">7 min</time>  </p>

               </header>
               <p>React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. If you're still using class components, it's time to learn about hooks.</p>

               <h4>What Are Hooks?
                </h4>
                <p>Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have become the standard way to write React components.</p>

                <h4>useState Hook
                </h4>
                <p>The useState hook lets you add state to functional components. Instead of using this.state, you can now use state directly in your function 
                </p>
                <code>
                    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
                </code>

                <h4>useEffect Hook</h4>
                <p>useEffect lets you perform side effects in functional components. It replaces componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.</p>
                <h4>
                    Custom Hooks
                </h4>

                <p>
                    You can create your own hooks to share logic between components. A custom hook is just a JavaScript function that uses other hooks.
                </p>

                <h4>Best Practices</h4>

                <p>
                    Always use hooks at the top level of your function. Don't call hooks conditionally. Use the ESLint plugin to catch mistakes.
                </p>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    Hooks make React code more readable, reusable, and easier to test. Start learning them today and level up your React skills.

                  <h3>ARTICLE 4: Understanding Async/Await in JavaScript</h3>
                <p><b>Published:</b>  <time datetime="2024-01-25">January 25, 2024</time> | <b>Author:</b> Emily Developer | <b>Reading Time: </b> <time datetime="">6 min</time>  </p>
              </header>
              <p>
                Async/await is a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It makes your code look and behave more like synchronous code, which is easier to understand.
              </p>
              <h4>From Callbacks to Promises to Async/Await
</h4>
<p>JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities have evolved over time. Callbacks were the original way, but they led to callback hell. Promises improved this, and async/await is the modern solution.</p>

<h4>
    The Basics
</h4>
<p>An async function is a function that returns a promise. Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword to pause execution until a promise settles.</p>

<h4>Error Handling
</h4>
<p>
    Use try/catch blocks to handle errors in async/await code. This is much cleaner than .catch() chains.
</p>

<h4>Real-World Example</h4>
<p>Fetching data from an API is the most common use case for async/await. You can fetch data, process it, and display it all in a clean, readable way.</p>

<h4>Performance Considerations
</h4>
<p>Parallel requests are faster than sequential ones. Use Promise.all() to make multiple requests at the same time.</p>

                   <h4>ARTICLE 5: CSS Grid vs Flexbox - When to Use Each</h4> 
                    <p><b>Published:</b>  <time datetime="2024-02-1">Feb 1, 2024</time> | <b>Author:</b> Emily Developer | <b>Reading Time: </b> <time datetime="">7 min</time>  </p>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools, but they're designed for different purposes. Understanding when to use each will make you a better developer.
                </p>
               
                <h4>Flexbox is One-Dimensional</h4>
                <p>Flexbox is best for layouts in one direction—either rows or columns. Perfect for navigation menus, button groups, or distributing items along a line.</p>

                <h4>Grid is Two-Dimensional
</h4>
                <p>
                    CSS Grid is designed for complex layouts involving rows AND columns. It's ideal for page layouts with headers, sidebars, and footers.
                </p>

                <h4>Flexbox Advantages
</h4>
    <p>Simple to understand and implement. Great for dynamic content that changes size. Perfect for component-level layouts.</p>


    <h4>
        Grid Advantages
    </h4>
    <p>
        Powerful for page-level layouts. Can create complex designs with minimal code. Better for fixed designs.
    </p>

    <h4>They Work Together</h4>
    <p>
        Grid and Flexbox are complementary. Use Grid for the page layout and Flexbox for component layouts
    </p>

   <summary>
     <h4>Practical Tips</h4>
    <p>
        Start with Flexbox for simpler layouts. Move to Grid when you need two-dimensional control. Don't force one to do the job of the other.
    </p>
